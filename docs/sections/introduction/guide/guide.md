# Guide

This entire website contains documentation and details for [this repository](https://github.com/a-y-u-s-h/apps). 


### Quickstart

Applications in this collection are supposed to be full fledged applications, independent of each other or complete in themsleves. So there's no **one way** to get started with them all, though as this show progresses, there's going to be quickstart docs for each of those individual applications. 

### Contribution

This project is something that the author is working on to stay sane in this world of noise. To get great sleep at night and to understand & develop mastery over tools, data structures and algorithms. It's a pet passion project that maybe someday can start earning some donations or get the author some remote jobs or gigs when he needs them, so it's best that this doesn't include any code contributions. 

But if you'd like to contribute in some way, please share these with your friends, family and coworkers in any way you can when it becomes worthy of share. Author of this collection is same as that of [Javascript Experiments](https://ayushsharma.net/experiments) which gained some popularity among engineering students and friends in the year 2017, for which he's grateful.
