<h2 align="center">Collection of Standalone, Useful & Beautiful Applications</h2>

**apps*** is a collection of several standalone, sometimes framework-agnostic, well documented applications written in several languages. This repository is a collection of applications, scripts made by [Ayush Sharma](https://ayushsharma.net/portfolio) as hobby project. It began on April 1 2020, and is intended to continue until the author becomes occupied with something more important.
